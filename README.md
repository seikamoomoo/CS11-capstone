## Generate Mesh

### Setup
* create virtual env: `python -m venv .venv`
* start virtual env: `source .venv/bin/activate`
* install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* download Python 3 module: https://www.agisoft.com/downloads/installer/
* install wheel: https://agisoft.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/31000148930-how-to-install-metashape-stand-alone-python-module
* activate license: `export agisoft_LICENSE=7250@linlic.engr.oregonstate.edu`
* start app: `python app.py [path to MetashapePro]`

### Metashape Script Only
* run script: [path to MetashapePro] -r metashape_script.py [project name] [point cloud file path] [custom face count]

###Using the Unreal Engine Demo to View FBX Models
* Go to the Unreal Engine Demo folder that you have downloaded and double click on the following file : FBXImportDemo.exe
* Camera controls :
  * W - Forwards
  * A - Left
  * S - Backwards
  * D - Right
  * Hold right mouse button to move your camera in accordance to where you are pointing the mouse

* Click on the green plane with the left mouse button. This will make a small yellow marker appear.
  * Make sure you click close to your current position as the further out you click the further away the model will be. 
* Click on the Import FBX button at the top left of the screen and search through the file manager until you find the FBX file you want to import.
* Double click on the FBX file and wait while the demo loads your FBX file. A loading bar should appear.
