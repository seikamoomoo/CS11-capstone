### Sprint Review
We spent much of this sprint compiling research and gathering equipment. We completed Milestone 2, designed the system architecture, and analyzed a variety of different cameras. Every week, we met with our TA and our project partners. Throughout these first weeks, we became more familiar with the technology and process flows involved in photogrammetry and 3D modeling.

Although we had a slow start, we made significant progress as soon as we obtained the laptops we needed to run Meshroom. We were able to test different photogrammetry pipeline configurations and create several models. In addition, we tested DotProduct and started developing a Python GUI. Although it has yet to be decided, it seems that we are most likely going to be using Meshroom instead of DotProduct. We have not yet started incorporating Unreal Engine into our system; our current work involves developing a UI and photogrammetry pipeline that suits the goals of our project.
